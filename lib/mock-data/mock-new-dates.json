The development brings the leading provider of API-based connectivity to small business financial software a step closer to banks running the Finxact core.\n\nCodat's universal API leverages a single data model which allows financial institutions and software providers to build integrated products with access to their SME's standardized financial data across the most broadly adopted accounting, eCommerce, payments, and banking software applications. Historically, SME financial data have been siloed, and hard for banks to access in a way that lets them readily tailor product offerings for their customers to meet them with what they need when they need it most. Codat is bringing the bank nearer to a day-in-the life of their SME customers, with real-time connectivity to data that tells the bank exactly how it can be most helpful to their SMEs with products spanning payables, receivables, onboarding, decisioning, monitoring, and forecasting.\n\n\"We've already wowed a number of Finxact prospects demonstrating the power of Codat's API and the Finxact core. The connectivity to SME financial data, both data-in and data-out, is practically creating the business requirement documents for bankers to tailor products for their small business customers,\" said Cooper Thompson, Vice President of Innovation for Finxact.\n\n\"We are excited to be working with Finxact to provide the regional banking sector with an unparalleled level of speed and automation when onboarding small business customers and providing them with banking services. Like Codat, Finxact recognizes the significance of providing clients with the whole story in real-time, something that can only be achieved with direct integration into the systems small businesses use regularly,\" said Phil Low, Head of Partnerships at Codat.\n\nThe Finxact Marketplace attracts the leading fintechs and banking technology providers to position their solutions to the market integrated with the leading next gen core platform via its open-API architecture. In the Marketplace, banks can readily identify solutions for which they may become the driver for API-based integration, as well as those solutions that are pre-integrated and form part of the Finxact reference ecosystem in production environments.\n\nFinxact's headless core is a SaaS platform engineered to support the scale and regulatory requirements of the largest U.S.-based financial institutions.

        "content": "Codat, the universal API for small business data, today announced the launch of Sync for Commerce, which will automatically synchronize sales data with accounting platforms.\n\nA growing number of merchants use digital payment tools; in fact, Codat research found that a majority of US merchants use more than one commerce platform, which adds to their reconciliation burden. Payment providers will use Sync for Commerce to make building automated reconciliation features radically quicker and simpler, so that their merchants can get back to focusing on growing their business.\n\nMore and more businesses are employing multi-channel commerce strategies. According to a recent global survey by Codat, 82% of the businesses who responded said they were using at least one digital payments tool. The top providers of these tools are PayPal, Amazon, Square, and Shopify. In addition, 55% of companies using a digital payments platform were using more than one.\n\nWhile the use of digital payments solutions has clear benefits, the adoption of multiple commerce platforms makes it more difficult to get a clear picture of the business and adds to back-office workload.. When using multiple commerce platforms, the burden of reconciling those accounts falls on the shoulders of small business owners, who spend an estimated 40 hours per month on administration. Integrations like Codat’s automate this process, giving business owners and their teams more time to focus on growth.\n\n“Everyone in the payments stack is looking to do more for their merchants. Automatically syncing data with accounting systems has long been a sought-after feature by merchants and providers in this equation because of its potential for time-saving. But because of the technical complexity to implement, integrations that exist today are often low quality, poorly reviewed, with patchy coverage and disjointed user experiences” said Pete Lord, Codat’s CEO. “Sync for Commerce changes this. It’s about enabling providers to deliver high quality, native integrations as a competitive feature in days or weeks not months and years.”\n\nThe new product simplifies how payments providers and commerce platforms let their users sync their data with the most popular accounting platforms: Intuit QuickBooks and Xero. Sales and payments data are sent in real-time to Codat’s new API, which turns the raw data into detailed sales invoices and sends these to the merchant’s accounting platform. Merchants can set their connection up in minutes and choose exactly when and how they want the sync to occur. Mollie, one of Europe’s fastest-growing payment service providers, will be among the first to implement Codat’s new product.\n\n\"Mollie makes it easy for merchants to accept all major payment methods. A key part of this is making sure that accepting more payments does not create more of an admin burden for bookkeeping and reconciliation.” commented Mollie Chief Commercial Officer, Ken Serdons, “By simplifying how Mollie connects to accounting platforms, Codat is helping us remove a barrier to adoption and build deeper, more valuable relationships with our merchants.\""
